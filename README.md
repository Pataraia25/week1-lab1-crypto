## Week 1 – Lab 1: Cryptography Fundamentals and Pentesting Basics

This lab demonstrates the weaknesses of classical cryptographic techniques through practical decryption exercises. In the first part, a Caesar cipher attack was performed on the provided ciphertext “Hvs Eiwqy Pfckb Tcl Xiadg Cjsf Hvs Zonm Rcu.” by brute-forcing all 26 possible shifts. The correct plaintext, “The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.”, was recovered without prior knowledge of the key, illustrating the insecurity of the Caesar cipher due to its extremely small keyspace and preserved language patterns.

In the second part, a shorter Caesar-encrypted ciphertext, “mznxpz”, was analyzed using the same brute-force approach. The readable result appeared at shift 21 as “rescue”. According to the assignment instructions, this value represents an anagram of the final passphrase. Rearranging the letters yields “secure”, a fundamental concept in cryptography, which was used as the key for the next step.

In the final part, the Base64-encoded ciphertext “Jw0KBlIMAEUXHRdFKyoxVRENEgkPEBwCFkQ=” was decoded into raw bytes and XOR-decrypted using the repeating key “secure”. This process produced a readable plaintext message, demonstrating that XOR encryption provides no meaningful security when used with short, predictable, or reused keys. The lab as a whole shows that combining weak techniques such as Caesar ciphers, simple obfuscation, XOR encryption, and Base64 encoding does not result in secure encryption, reinforcing the need for strong algorithms and proper key management in real-world cryptographic systems.
